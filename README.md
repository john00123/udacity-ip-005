####Developer notes:

- The code relies on Jquery, so it's recommended to enable JavaScript in your browser to enable full functionality.

- Make sure you are running the latest version of Firefox, Chrome or Safari as there is a flex box dependency.

- This game uses google fonts to render "Open sans".

- The logic and structure of this game is dynamic. It will generate the number of cards and steps needed to win as necessary, you will need to make sure you add, two values on the initial card variable to avoid leaving the user with a odd number of cards.
